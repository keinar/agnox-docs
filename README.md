## What Problem Does This Solve?

**The Challenge:** Test automation teams struggle with:
- Managing different frameworks (Playwright, Selenium, Pytest, etc.) across environments
- Debugging failures without clear root cause analysis
- Scaling test infrastructure for multiple teams
- Maintaining secure, isolated test environments

**The Solution:** Agnox provides:
- **Framework-agnostic execution** - Bring your own Docker image, we handle the rest
- **AI-powered debugging** - Instant root cause analysis for test failures
- **AI Quality Orchestrator** - Auto-bug generation, flakiness detection, test optimization, smart PR routing, and natural-language data queries
- **Multi-tenant SaaS** - Complete isolation between teams/organizations
- **Real-time monitoring** - Live logs, WebSocket updates, interactive dashboard
- **Smart environment management** - Dynamic configuration injection per test run

---

## Key Features

### AI-Powered Root Cause Analysis

No more digging through thousands of log lines.

- **Automatic Detection:** When tests fail, the system captures logs automatically
- **Dual-Agent Pipeline:** Two sequential Gemini 2.5 Flash calls — an **Analyzer** generates a structured root cause + fix as JSON, then a **Critic** evaluates it against the raw logs and overrides hallucinations before producing the final developer-facing Markdown
- **Privacy Controls:** Organization-level toggle to opt-out of AI processing
- **Instant Reports:** View styled analysis directly in the dashboard via the Investigation Hub AI Analysis tab

### Multi-Tenant SaaS Architecture

Complete isolation and security for multiple organizations.

- **Organization Management:** Each signup creates an isolated organization
- **Team Collaboration:** Invite members with role-based permissions (Admin/Developer/Viewer)
- **Data Isolation:** Organizations cannot see or access each other's data
- **Usage Tracking:** Per-organization quotas and limits based on subscription plan

### Modern Full-Screen Dashboard

A professional React 19 + Tailwind CSS interface built for power users.

- **Full-Screen Layout:** Edge-to-edge design with no artificial width constraints, maximizing visible data
- **Collapsible Sidebar:** Persistent navigation sidebar with Dashboard, Settings, and Docs links. Collapsed state is persisted in `localStorage`
- **AppLayout / Outlet Pattern:** React Router's nested layout pattern - the `AppLayout` component renders the `<Outlet />`, ensuring the Sidebar and global chrome are shared across all pages without re-mounting
- **Manual Triggers:** Launch tests directly from the UI using the Execution Modal - Docker image, Target URL, and Test Folder are pre-filled from saved project settings
- **Live Monitoring:** Watch console logs stream in real-time via Socket.io WebSockets
- **Settings Management:** Manage team members, organization settings, usage quotas, and per-project run configuration

### Advanced Run Management

Powerful organization and control over test executions.

- **Grouped vs. Flat View:** Toggle between a flat chronological list and a grouped view that aggregates runs by `groupName`. Both views support full filtering and pagination
- **Group Collapsing:** In Grouped view, each group header shows a pass/fail summary badge and last run timestamp. Click to expand or collapse the child executions
- **Bulk Actions Bar:** A floating action bar appears when one or more rows are selected. Supports:
  - **Group Selected** - assign a group name to multiple executions at once (popover input)
  - **Ungroup Selected** - remove the group assignment from selected executions
  - **Delete Selected** - soft-delete up to 100 executions in a single operation
- **Pagination:** Both flat and grouped views are fully paginated, with "Showing X-Y of Z results" context, Prev/Next controls, and loading state dimming
- **Persistent View Mode:** The active view mode (flat or grouped) is saved to `localStorage` across sessions

### Smart Real-Time Analytics

Live KPI dashboard powered by MongoDB server-side aggregation.

- **Total Runs:** Count of all test executions in the current calendar month, scoped to the organization
- **Success Rate:** Computed as `PASSED / finishedRuns X 100`, rounded to one decimal place. Excludes in-progress runs (RUNNING, PENDING, ANALYZING) to avoid misleading percentages
- **Average Duration:** Mean execution time in milliseconds across all finished runs that have an `endTime`
- **TanStack Query Integration:** KPIs are fetched with a 60-second stale window, 2 automatic retries, and a local skeleton-loading state while the request is in flight
- **Zero-State Handling:** If no executions exist for the current month, all KPIs display as 0 without errors

### Dynamic Jira Integration

First-class bug-filing directly from the dashboard.

- **Custom Field Schema:** The Jira project's `createmeta` endpoint is fetched at modal open time. Any custom fields (`customfield_*`) defined in the project are dynamically rendered - no hardcoded field lists
- **ADF Formatting:** Issue descriptions are built using Atlassian Document Format (ADF) for rich, structured content including code blocks, bullet lists, and paragraph nodes
- **Bidirectional Linkage:** Filed tickets are stored in MongoDB and linked back to their originating execution record
- **Assignee Selection:** Supports dynamic assignee lookup and selection within the modal

### Enterprise-Grade Security

Built with security best practices from the ground up.

- **JWT Authentication:** HS256 algorithm pinning with Redis-backed revocation blacklist
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Admin, Developer, Viewer roles
- **API Key Security:** Server-side HMAC-SHA256 hashing for secure revocation
- **Attack Surface Minimization:** Strict SSRF domain allowlisting and HMAC-signed static artifact access 
- **Data at Rest:** AES-256-GCM encryption for stored integration secrets
- **Rate Limiting:** Per-organization and per-IP rate limiting (Redis-based)
- **Account Protection:** Login attempt tracking with automatic lockout (15 min after 5 failures)
- **Security Headers:** OWASP-recommended headers (HSTS preload, CSP-ready, X-Frame-Options)
- **CORS Protection:** Environment-based origin validation
- **5-Layer AI Pipeline Sanitizer:** Every LLM-generated MongoDB pipeline passes through a mandatory sanitizer (`chat-sanitizer.ts`) enforcing a stage allowlist, forced `organizationId` injection, `$limit` cap, collection whitelist, and recursive operator scan — preventing NoSQL injection via AI-generated queries
- **Webhook HMAC Verification:** PR Routing webhooks enforce enterprise-grade `X-Hub-Signature-256` HMAC-SHA256 validation (constant-time comparison) — unsigned or tampered GitHub deliveries are rejected before any processing occurs
- **Synchronous Startup Guard:** The producer service validates `ENCRYPTION_KEY` (exactly 32 chars), `PLATFORM_JWT_SECRET`, and `PLATFORM_MONGO_URI` at boot — refusing to start if any required secret is missing or malformed

### Native Playwright Reporter

Stream live Playwright test results to your Agnox dashboard without wrapping tests in a Docker container.

- **Zero-friction install:** Add `@agnox/playwright-reporter` to your existing Playwright config — no Dockerfile, no CI changes
- **Live ingest:** Test results stream to the Ingest API (`/api/ingest/*`) in real-time as each test completes
- **Batched delivery:** `EventBatcher` groups events and flushes every 2 s (configurable) to minimize HTTP overhead
- **Auto CI detection:** Automatically detects GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Azure DevOps, and Jenkins environment variables and attaches CI context (repository, branch, PR number, commit SHA, run URL) to the session
- **Do No Harm:** All reporter errors are caught and suppressed — the reporter is always a silent no-op if the Agnox API is unreachable; your test suite is never affected
- **Dashboard source filter:** Runs from the reporter appear as `external-ci` source in the Dashboard. Use the **Source** filter to separate **External CI** passive runs from **Agnox Hosted** Docker runs

**Usage (`playwright.config.ts`):**
```typescript
import AgnoxReporter from '@agnox/playwright-reporter';
export default defineConfig({
  reporter: [
    ['list'],
    [AgnoxReporter, {
      apiKey:    process.env.AGNOX_API_KEY,
      projectId: process.env.AGNOX_PROJECT_ID,
    }],
  ],
});
```

### Smart Environment Mapping & Secrets Management

Framework-agnostic environment configuration with first-class secret support. Test images and environment variables are **managed per-organization in the Database**, not in a `.env` file.

- **Per-Project Environments:** Define Dev, Staging, and Production URLs per project in **Settings → Run Settings** (stored in the database, not server ENV variables)
- **Auto-Switching:** The Execution Modal automatically maps environment selection to the correct URL
- **Dynamic Injection:** Environment variables injected into containers at runtime via Docker `Env` configuration
- **Per-Project Env Variables:** Define `KEY=VALUE` pairs under **Settings → Env Variables**. Variables are fetched and merged server-side before each run — no client-side plaintext exposure
- **Secret Encryption:** Mark any variable as **Secret** to encrypt its value at rest with AES-256-GCM. The UI returns `••••••••` for secrets; plaintext is only ever in-memory during decryption at run time
- **Log Sanitization:** The worker service automatically redacts secret values from all streamed container logs, preventing accidental leakage in the dashboard or persistent log storage

### Billing & Subscription Management

Integrated Stripe-powered subscription system.

- **Subscription Plans:** Free, Team, and Enterprise tiers with different limits
- **Stripe Integration:** Secure payment processing via Stripe Checkout
- **Plan Limits Enforcement:** Test runs, team members, concurrent runs per plan
- **Usage Tracking:** Real-time usage statistics and quota monitoring
- **Self-Service Billing:** Upgrade/downgrade plans directly from the dashboard

### User Profile Management

Personal account management for all users.

- **Profile Settings:** Update name and view account details
- **Read-Only Security:** Email and role displayed but not editable by user
- **Role-Based Access:** Profile visible to all, role changes by admins only

### Email Integration

Professional email communications via SendGrid.

- **Team Invitations:** HTML email invitations with one-click join
- **Welcome Emails:** Onboarding emails for new team members
- **Transactional Emails:** Password reset, notifications (coming soon)

## Connecting an Automation Project

The **Agnox CLI** ([`@agnox/agnox-cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@agnox/agnox-cli)) is the official tool for preparing and connecting any test automation repository to the platform.

### Quick Start

```bash
npx @agnox/agnox-cli@latest init
```

### What It Does

- **Generates integration files** - `Dockerfile`, `entrypoint.sh`, `.dockerignore` tailored to your framework
- **Auto-detects Playwright version** from your `package.json` and pins the correct Docker base image
- **Builds a multi-platform Docker image** (`linux/amd64` + `linux/arm64`) and pushes it to Docker Hub
- **Supported frameworks:** Playwright (TypeScript/Node.js) and Pytest (Python)

### After Running the CLI

Once the image is pushed to Docker Hub:

1. Open the **Agnox Dashboard**
2. Go to **Settings → Run Settings**
3. Create a new project and enter the Docker image name
4. Configure your environment URLs (Dev/Staging/Prod)

The platform will use this image and configuration for all future test runs launched from the Execution Modal.

📦 **CLI Repository:** [github.com/agnox/agnox-cli](https://github.com/agnox/agnox-cli) ·· **npm:** [@agnox/agnox-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@agnox/agnox-cli)

## Quick Start: Integrate Your Automation Project

### Step 1: Create Your Account

1. **Sign up** at the dashboard (contact: info@digital-solution.co.il for access)
2. **Your organization is created automatically**
3. **You're the admin** - invite team members via Settings → Team Members

### Step 2: Get Your API Key

1. Login to the dashboard
2. Navigate to **Settings → Profile → API Access**
3. Click **Generate API Key** and copy it (shown only once)

### Step 3: Configure Your Test Project

The platform works with **any containerized test framework**. Here's how to integrate:

#### Option A: Use the API Directly

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.agnox.dev/api/execution-request \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: <REDACTED_API_KEY>" \
  -d '{
    "taskId": "run-'$(date +%s)'",
    "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.40.0",
    "command": "npx playwright test",
    "folder": "tests/e2e",
    "groupName": "nightly-regression",
    "config": {
      "environment": "staging",
      "baseUrl": "https://staging.agnox.dev"
    }
  }'
```

#### Option B: Dedicated CI/CD Trigger (Recommended for Pipelines)

Use `POST /api/ci/trigger` to start a test cycle from your pipeline and automatically attach CI context (repository, PR number, commit SHA). The cycle appears in Test Cycles with a name derived from the repository and PR number.

**Your Project ID** is shown in **Settings → Run Settings** → Execution Defaults (copy it with the one-click button).

**GitHub Actions Example:**

```yaml
name: Run E2E Tests
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Trigger Tests via Agnox CI Endpoint
        run: |
          curl -X POST ${{ secrets.AGNOX_API_URL }}/api/ci/trigger \
            -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
            -H "x-api-key: ${{ secrets.AGNOX_API_KEY }}" \
            -d '{
              "projectId": "${{ secrets.AGNOX_PROJECT_ID }}",
              "image": "myorg/my-tests:latest",
              "command": "npx playwright test",
              "folder": "tests/e2e",
              "config": {
                "environment": "staging",
                "baseUrl": "${{ secrets.STAGING_URL }}"
              },
              "ciContext": {
                "source": "github",
                "repository": "${{ github.repository }}",
                "prNumber": ${{ github.event.number || 0 }},
                "commitSha": "${{ github.sha }}"
              }
            }'
```

**GitLab CI Example:**

```yaml
e2e-tests:
  stage: test
  script:
    - |
      curl -X POST $AGNOX_API_URL/api/ci/trigger \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -H "x-api-key: $AGNOX_API_KEY" \
        -d '{
          "projectId": "'"$AGNOX_PROJECT_ID"'",
          "image": "myorg/my-tests:latest",
          "command": "npx playwright test",
          "folder": "tests/e2e",
          "config": { "environment": "staging" },
          "ciContext": {
            "source": "gitlab",
            "repository": "'"$CI_PROJECT_PATH"'",
            "commitSha": "'"$CI_COMMIT_SHA"'"
          }
        }'
```

#### Option C: Generic Execution Request

For simple runs without CI context, call the generic execution endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST ${{ secrets.AUTOMATION_API_URL }}/api/execution-request \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: ${{ secrets.AGNOX_API_KEY }}" \
  -d '{
    "taskId": "ci-run-'$(date +%s)'",
    "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.40.0",
    "command": "npm test",
    "folder": "tests",
    "groupName": "ci-main",
    "config": {
      "environment": "production",
      "baseUrl": "https://prod.myapp.com"
    }
  }'
```

#### Option D: Native Playwright Reporter (No Docker Required)

Install the official reporter and stream live results directly from your existing Playwright runs:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @agnox/playwright-reporter
```

```typescript
// playwright.config.ts
import AgnoxReporter from '@agnox/playwright-reporter';
export default defineConfig({
  reporter: [
    ['list'],
    [AgnoxReporter, {
      apiKey:    process.env.AGNOX_API_KEY,
      projectId: process.env.AGNOX_PROJECT_ID,
      // Optional: environment, runName, debug
    }],
  ],
});
```

The reporter auto-detects your CI provider and attaches the branch, PR number, and commit SHA. Results appear in the Dashboard under the **External CI** source filter.

#### Option E (Legacy): Node.js Integration

```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

async function runTests() {
  const response = await axios.post(
    'https://api.agnox.dev/api/execution-request',
    {
      taskId: `run-${Date.now()}`,
      image: 'mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.40.0',
      command: 'npx playwright test',
      folder: 'tests/integration',
      groupName: 'smoke-suite',
      config: {
        environment: 'staging',
        baseUrl: 'https://staging.agnox.dev',
      },
    },
    {
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'x-api-key': process.env.AAC_API_KEY,
      },
    }
  );

  console.log('Test execution started:', response.data.taskId);
}

runTests();
```

### Step 4: Monitor Test Execution

1. **Live Dashboard:** Watch tests execute in real-time at the dashboard
2. **WebSocket Updates:** See logs stream live via Socket.io
3. **AI Analysis:** If tests fail, AI automatically analyzes root cause
4. **Reports:** Access HTML and Allure reports via the dashboard

---

## Supported Test Frameworks

The platform is **framework-agnostic** - any Docker-based test framework works:

| Framework | Docker Image Example | Command Example |
|-----------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Playwright** | `mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.40.0` | `npx playwright test` |
| **Cypress** | `cypress/included:13.6.0` | `cypress run` |
| **Selenium** | `selenium/standalone-chrome:latest` | `pytest tests/` |
| **Pytest** | `python:3.11-slim` | `pytest --html=report.html` |
| **JUnit** | `openjdk:17-slim` | `mvn test` |
| **Custom** | Any Docker image | Any command |

---

## Smart PR Webhooks (AI-Driven Routing)

Smart PR Routing (Feature D) is an AI-powered mechanism that automatically selects **which tests to run** based on which files changed in a pull request — eliminating the need to run the full test suite on every push.

### Concept

When a GitHub push or pull_request webhook fires, the Producer Service:
1. Extracts the list of changed files from the payload (`commits[].added/modified/removed` or a custom `body.changedFiles[]` array).
2. Queries the `projectTestStructures` collection for a pre-seeded map of the project's test folder layout.
3. Passes the changed files + test structure to the configured LLM (Gemini / OpenAI / Anthropic) with a prompt asking it to select the most relevant test subfolder or spec file.
4. Dispatches a targeted RabbitMQ task (via `npx playwright test <selected-folder>`) instead of running the full suite.
5. Writes a `PENDING` execution document with `trigger: 'github'`, `isSmartPR: true`, and the extracted `ciContext` (repository, branch, commit, PR URL) so the dashboard displays a **Smart PR** badge and a full CI context panel.

### Manifest Seeding Phase

> **Important:** The LLM can only route accurately to specific test files if it knows what test files exist.

Before Smart PR Routing will route to individual spec files, a project must be run **at least once** (manually from the dashboard, or via the `/api/ci/trigger` endpoint) so that the worker can discover and record the test folder structure into the `projectTestStructures` MongoDB collection.

Without a seeded manifest, the LLM falls back to a generic prompt that maps file changes to broad categories (e.g., UI changes → `tests/ui`). This still works, but is less precise.

**To seed the manifest:**
1. Configure Docker image + test folder in **Settings → Run Settings**.
2. Trigger one full run (click **Run Tests** in the dashboard, or POST to `/api/ci/trigger`).
3. After the run completes the manifest is stored. Future Smart PR webhook calls will use it automatically.

### Environment Selection (`?env=` parameter)

By default, Smart PR Routing selects the target URL using a priority chain: `staging → dev → prod` (whichever is configured first in your Run Settings).

You can **pin a specific environment** by appending `?env=<tier>` to the webhook URL:

| Parameter | Target URL used | `environment` label |
|-----------|----------------|---------------------|
| `?env=staging` | `targetUrls.staging` | `staging` |
| `?env=dev`     | `targetUrls.dev`     | `development` |
| `?env=prod`    | `targetUrls.prod`    | `production` |

If the specified tier's URL is not configured, the system automatically falls back to the legacy priority chain and logs a warning.

**GitHub Actions example:**
```yaml
- name: Trigger Smart PR Tests
  run: |
    curl -X POST ${{ secrets.AGNOX_API_URL }}/api/webhooks/ci/pr?token=${{ secrets.AGNOX_ORG_ID }}&env=prod \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -H "X-Hub-Signature-256: sha256=$(echo -n '${{ toJson(github.event) }}' | openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac '${{ secrets.WEBHOOK_SECRET }}' | cut -d' ' -f2)" \
      -d '${{ toJson(github.event) }}'
```

### Webhook Registration

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Endpoint** | `POST /api/webhooks/ci/pr?token=<orgId>&env=prod&groupName=Smart-PR-Run` |
| **Auth** | No JWT — the `?token=` param is your Organization ID |
| **Signature** | Optional `X-Hub-Signature-256` (HMAC-SHA256) — configure `webhookSecret` in your org to enforce it |
| **Feature flag** | `aiFeatures.prRouting` must be enabled (Settings → Run Settings → Smart PR Routing toggle) |
| **Payload** | GitHub push / pull_request webhook JSON, or `{ changedFiles: string[] }` for other CI systems |
| **Smart PR Badge** | Every dispatched execution carries `isSmartPR: true` — a **Smart PR** badge renders in the Execution List for at-a-glance identification |
| **AI Reasoning Audit Trail** | The LLM's folder-selection rationale (`aiReasoning`) is persisted on the execution and surfaced in the Investigation Hub for full auditability |
| **`groupName` default** | Defaults to `'Smart-PR-Run'` when `?groupName=` is omitted, ensuring Auto-Quarantine and Flakiness Detective always receive historical data |

Returns executions aggregated by `groupName` using a MongoDB `$group` + `$facet` aggregation pipeline. Executions without a `groupName` are placed in a synthetic `__ungrouped__` bucket.

**Query Parameters:** Same as `GET /api/executions`, except:

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `limit` | number | `10` | Groups per page (max `50`) |
| `offset` | number | `0` | Zero-based group offset |

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "groups": [
      {
        "groupName": "nightly-regression",
        "totalCount": 24,
        "passCount": 22,
        "lastRunAt": "2026-02-19T23:15:00.000Z",
        "executions": [...]
      }
    ],
    "totalGroups": 8,
    "limit": 10,
    "offset": 0
  }
}
```

---

#### PATCH `/api/executions/bulk`

Updates a whitelisted field on up to 100 executions in a single operation. Currently supports setting or removing `groupName`. Passing `null` or an empty string for `groupName` removes the field (ungroups).

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "taskIds": ["task-001", "task-002"],
  "data": { "groupName": "sprint-42" }
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { "modifiedCount": 2 }
}
```

---

#### DELETE `/api/executions/bulk`

Soft-deletes up to 100 executions at once. Records are not removed from the database - a `deletedAt` timestamp is written to preserve billing accuracy.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "taskIds": ["task-001", "task-002"]
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { "deletedCount": 2 }
}
```

---

### Execution Requests

#### POST `/api/execution-request`

Queues a new test execution. Accepts an optional `groupName` and `batchId` for grouping.

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `taskId` | string | Yes | Unique identifier for this execution |
| `image` | string | Yes | Docker image to run |
| `command` | string | Yes | Command to execute inside the container |

- **Log Sanitization:** `sanitizeLogLine()` in the worker redacts secret values from every streamed log line before dashboard delivery or persistent storage
- **Settings UI:** `EnvironmentVariablesTab` with Add/Edit form, secret toggle switch, masked table view, and inline Edit/Delete actions

---

### v3.10.0 — AI Quality Orchestrator ✅

**Status:** Production Ready

A full suite of AI-powered quality tools, each independently toggled per organization in **Settings → Features**.

- **Feature A — Auto-Bug Generator:** Click "Auto Bug" on any FAILED/ERROR execution in the Investigation Hub to generate a structured bug report (title, steps to reproduce, expected/actual behavior, severity, code patch suggestions). Edit before submitting directly to Jira via the pre-filled `CreateJiraTicketModal`.
- **Feature B — Flakiness Detective:** New `/stability` page analyzes a test group's last 20 executions to produce a flakiness score (0–100 gauge), verdict badge (Stable → Highly Unstable), findings list, and recommendations. Results are persisted in `stability_reports` and displayed in a clickable history panel.
- **Feature C — Test Case Optimizer:** Select test cases in the Test Cases page and click "Optimize with AI". A dual-agent pipeline (Analyzer → Critic) returns BDD-formatted steps, detected duplicates, and new edge cases in a side-by-side diff modal. Apply per-case or all at once.
- **Feature D — Smart PR Routing:** Configure a webhook in GitHub → Agnox maps changed files to the correct test folder via LLM → dispatches a RabbitMQ run automatically. PR Routing toggle and webhook URL callout in **Settings → Run Settings**. Each dispatched execution carries a **Smart PR badge** (`isSmartPR: true`) and an `aiReasoning` field surfaced in the Investigation Hub. Runs are automatically grouped under `'Smart-PR-Run'` when `?groupName=` is omitted.
- **Feature E — Quality Chatbot:** New `/chat` page with a two-panel conversational UI. Ask natural-language questions about your test data; the LLM generates a MongoDB aggregation pipeline (sanitized through a 5-layer NoSQL injection guard), executes it, and returns a plain-English answer with optional bar charts.
- **BYOK Support:** **Settings → Security** now lets admins select the org's default AI model and store per-provider API keys (Gemini / OpenAI / Anthropic) encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM. The platform key is used as fallback.

---

### v3.7.0 — CI/CD API Key Integration ✅

**Status:** Production Ready

- **`/api/ci/trigger` API Key Auth:** The dedicated CI/CD trigger endpoint now accepts `x-api-key` header authentication via `createApiKeyAuthMiddleware`. The global JWT middleware bypasses this route; auth is handled dynamically at the route level — tries API key first, falls back to Bearer JWT. CI tools no longer need to obtain a user Bearer token.
- **Project ID in Run Settings:** `RunSettingsTab` now displays a read-only **Project ID** field with a one-click **Copy** button at the top of the Execution Defaults section. Required when calling `POST /api/ci/trigger` from pipelines.

---

### v3.5.0 — Automated Docker Lifecycle & Multi-Tenant Reliability ✅

**Status:** Production Ready

#### Automated Test Image Sync

Every push to the `tests/` directory (or to `main`) triggers a GitHub Actions job that builds and publishes a multi-platform Docker image to Docker Hub — no manual intervention required.

- **Multi-Platform Build:** The `build-test-image` job uses Docker Buildx to produce a single manifest covering `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`, ensuring the image runs on both cloud VM types (Oracle Cloud ARM64 and standard x86 servers).
- **Automatic Publishing:** The image is pushed to `keinar101/agnox-tests:latest` after every successful quality-check pipeline.
- **User Workflow:** Make changes to your tests, run `git push`, and the platform handles the rest. In **Settings → Run Settings**, ensure your project's Docker Image field is set to `keinar101/agnox-tests:latest` so every subsequent execution picks up the freshly built image.
- **Manual Build:** To reproduce the CI build locally for debugging:
  ```bash
  docker buildx build \
    --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 \
    -t keinar101/agnox-tests:latest \
    --push .
  ```
  > Requires `docker buildx` and an active Docker Hub session (`docker login`).

#### Fair Scheduling via RabbitMQ Priority Queue

Prevents large organizations from starving smaller ones during peak load.

- **Priority Queue:** `test_queue` is declared with `x-max-priority: 10`. Every message is assigned a priority from 1 (lowest) to 10 (highest) before being enqueued.
- **Dynamic Priority Calculation:** `computeOrgPriority()` in `utils/scheduling.ts` counts an organization's currently RUNNING executions and computes `priority = max(1, 10 - runningCount * 2)`. An org already running 5 concurrent jobs receives priority 1; an idle org receives priority 10.
- **Effect:** The RabbitMQ broker delivers higher-priority messages first, ensuring active large orgs do not block idle small orgs.

#### Hardened Playwright Timeouts & Worker Scaling (Fail-Fast)

Worker efficiency is improved by bounding test execution time and scaling horizontally.

- Playwright is configured with `retries: 0` — no automatic retries on flaky failures; every failure surfaces immediately.
- A **15-second global timeout** and a **5-second `actionTimeout`** apply to each test. Long-running or stuck tests are terminated quickly, freeing the worker container for the next job.
- **Worker scaling:** `docker-compose.prod.yml` runs **10 worker replicas** via Docker Compose's `deploy.replicas: 10` with resource limits of `1.0 CPU` and `1 GB RAM` per replica. The worker service has no `container_name` so Docker can assign unique names per replica automatically.

#### Internal Monitoring Suite

Powers the ops dashboard at [status.agnox.dev](https://status.agnox.dev) with live infrastructure metrics.

- **Route:** `GET /api/system/monitor-status`
- **Auth:** Bypasses global JWT middleware. Requires the `X-Agnox-Monitor-Secret` header whose value must match the `MONITORING_SECRET_KEY` environment variable. Requests with a missing or invalid secret receive `401 Unauthorized`.
- **Response:** Returns a live JSON snapshot of RabbitMQ queue depth, active worker consumer count, and a MongoDB connectivity status.

```bash
# Example probe
curl -H "X-Agnox-Monitor-Secret: <your-secret>" \
  https://api.agnox.dev/api/system/monitor-status
```

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": "2026-02-27T12:00:00.000Z",
  "data": {
    "queueDepth": 3,
    "activeWorkers": 10,
    "dbConnected": true
  }
}
```

- **Status Dashboard:** `status-dashboard.html` is a standalone single-file ops page. Open it in any browser (no build step), configure the two constants at the top (`apiBase` and `monitorSecret`), and it will auto-refresh every 30 seconds. A "Fetch Now" button triggers an immediate poll. The dashboard shows a large green/red health banner, live counters for Pending Tasks and Active Workers, and a MongoDB connectivity indicator.

> **Setup:** Add `MONITORING_SECRET_KEY=<random-256-bit-hex>` to your `.env` and to the producer service's environment block in `docker-compose.prod.yml`. Use the same value in the `CONFIG.monitorSecret` constant inside `status-dashboard.html` (or inject it via your CI/CD pipeline).

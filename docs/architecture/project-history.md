## Phase 1: Multi-Tenant Foundation

### Key Deliverables
- Organization, User, and Invitation schemas
- JWT-based authentication with RBAC (Admin/Developer/Viewer)
- Multi-tenant data isolation (organizationId filtering)
- Database migration of 29 existing executions
- Security audit score: 87/100

### Lessons Learned

**What Went Well:**
- Clear phase planning with detailed task breakdown
- Comprehensive testing strategy (unit + integration)
- Security-first mindset from the start
- Database migration executed smoothly

**Challenges Resolved:**
- ObjectId vs string confusion in TypeScript → explicit conversions
- Socket.io authentication with JWT → auth.token handshake
- CORS configuration for Socket.io → separate CORS config
- Missing organizationId in worker callbacks → payload updates

**Metrics:**
- 38 tasks completed
- ~8,000 lines of code
- 24 hours total implementation time

---

## Phase 2: User Management UI

### Key Deliverables
- Team member management UI (invite, role change, remove)
- Organization settings interface
- AI privacy controls (opt-out capability)
- Redis-based rate limiting (per-org + per-IP)
- Security headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options)
- Login attempt tracking with lockout

### Lessons Learned

**What Went Well:**
- Leveraged Phase 1 foundation smoothly
- Comprehensive security enhancements in single sprint
- Mobile responsive design applied consistently
- Clear separation of concerns

**Challenges Resolved:**
- CORS with different origins → careful testing
- Rate limiting for auth vs authenticated → separate middleware
- Pure CSS responsive design → inline styles + custom CSS

---

## Phase 3: Billing Integration

### Key Deliverables
- Stripe subscription integration (Free/Team/Enterprise)
- Webhook handling with signature verification
- Plan limit enforcement middleware
- BillingTab UI component (614 lines)
- Usage alerts at 50%/80%/90% thresholds

### Lessons Learned

**What Went Well:**
- Stripe API well-documented, straightforward integration
- Idempotency design prevented duplicate processing issues
- Pure CSS maintained design consistency
- TypeScript caught many errors at compile time
- Docker Compose made local testing easy

**Challenges Resolved:**
- CORS errors in production → ALLOWED_ORIGINS env var + rebuild
- Dashboard using localhost → missing build args in compose
- TypeScript errors after JWT email field → updated 17 test mocks
- Raw body parsing for signatures → fastify-raw-body plugin

**Metrics:**
- ~5,600 lines of code
- 8 days implementation time
- Production deployed to agnox.dev

---

## Security Evolution

| Phase | Security Score | Key Additions |
|-------|----------------|---------------|
| Phase 1 | 87/100 | JWT auth, password hashing, data isolation |
| Phase 2 | 92/100 | Rate limiting, security headers, lockout |
| Phase 3 | 92/100 | Webhook signatures, HTTPS, CORS |

---

## Architecture Patterns Established

1. **Multi-Tenant Isolation**: OrganizationId filtering on all queries
2. **RBAC**: Admin/Developer/Viewer with middleware enforcement
3. **Audit Logging**: Admin action tracking in audit_logs collection
4. **Rate Limiting**: Three tiers (auth, API, strict)
5. **Webhook Processing**: Signature verification + idempotency
6. **Plan Limits**: Middleware enforcement with 402 responses

---

## Phase 4: Project Run Settings

### Key Deliverables
- Per-project Docker image and test folder configuration
- Per-project environment URLs (Dev, Staging, Production)
- Settings → Run Settings management tab
- Execution Modal pre-fills from saved project settings
- Shared types package (`@aac/shared-types`) for type safety across apps

### Lessons Learned

**What Went Well:**
- Clean separation between project config and execution concerns
- Shared types prevented frontend/backend drift
- Modal auto-fill reduced user friction significantly

---

## Phase 5: Email Integration

### Key Deliverables
- SendGrid transactional email integration (`@sendgrid/mail`)
- HTML email templates for team invitations
- Welcome emails for new team members
- Console logging fallback when SendGrid is not configured

### Lessons Learned

**What Went Well:**
- SendGrid integration was clean - single `@sendgrid/mail` package
- Graceful fallback to console logging for local development
- HTML templates provide professional email appearance

# Running & Managing Executions

The execution engine is the heart of Agnox. This guide covers triggering test runs, monitoring live output, and managing your execution history at scale.

---

## Running Tests

### Option A: Via Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Click **Run Test** (top right of the dashboard).
2. Select your **Project** — settings are pre-filled from Run Settings.
3. Select the **Environment** (Development / Staging / Production).
4. *(Optional)* Override the folder path.
5. *(Optional)* Enter a **Group Name** — use the smart combobox to select an existing group (appends to it) or type a new name to create one.
6. Click **Start Execution**.

### Option B: Via API

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.agnox.dev/api/executions \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "image": "your-dockerhub-user/my-tests:latest",
    "command": "npx playwright test",
    "environment": "staging",
    "baseUrl": "https://staging.myapp.com",
    "folder": "tests/e2e"
  }'
```

### Option C: CI/CD Trigger

Use `POST /api/ci/trigger` to start a run from your pipeline and pass CI context for automatic naming and traceability:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.agnox.dev/api/ci/trigger \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: $AGNOX_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "projectId": "<your-project-id>",
    "image": "myorg/my-tests:latest",
    "command": "npx playwright test",
    "folder": "tests/e2e",
    "config": {
      "environment": "staging",
      "baseUrl": "https://staging.myapp.com"
    },
    "ciContext": {
      "source": "github",
      "repository": "myorg/my-repo",
      "prNumber": 42,
      "commitSha": "abc1234"
    }
  }'
```

Returns `{ cycleId, taskId, status: "PENDING" }`. The cycle appears immediately in **Test Cycles** with a name derived from the repository and PR number.

**Find your Project ID:** Settings → Run Settings → select your project → copy the **Project ID** shown in the Execution Defaults section.

## Execution Status Lifecycle

```
PENDING → RUNNING → ANALYZING → PASSED / FAILED / UNSTABLE / ERROR
```

- **PENDING** — queued in RabbitMQ, waiting for a Worker
- **RUNNING** — Worker has started the Docker container; logs are streaming
- **ANALYZING** — container has exited; AI root-cause analysis is in progress
- **PASSED / FAILED / UNSTABLE / ERROR** — terminal state

---

## Live Logs & Investigation Hub

Click any execution row to open the **Investigation Hub** side drawer. The drawer URL updates with `?drawerId=<taskId>` — these links can be copied and shared directly.

The drawer has three tabs:

| Tab | Content |
|-----|---------|
| **Terminal** | Live log stream with auto-scroll toggle and `.txt` download |
| **Artifacts** | Media gallery — screenshots, videos, and downloadable trace zips |
| **AI Analysis** | Gemini-powered root-cause analysis for failed executions |

> The **AI Analysis** tab is hidden when the execution status is `ERROR` — AI cannot effectively analyze platform or container launch errors.

---

## Organizing Executions

### Flat vs. Grouped Views

Use the **View** toggle (top-right of the execution list) to switch modes:

- **Flat View** — all executions in reverse-chronological order; best for reviewing recent activity
- **Grouped View** — executions aggregated by `groupName`; each group shows a pass/fail summary badge and the timestamp of the most recent run; click a group header to expand or collapse

Both views support the full filter bar (status, environment, date range) and pagination.

### Bulk Actions

Select one or more execution rows using the checkboxes. A floating **Bulk Actions** bar appears with:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Assign Group** | Type a group name and apply it to all selected executions |
| **Ungroup** | Remove the `groupName` from selected executions |
| **Delete** | Soft-delete up to 100 executions in a single API call |

> Deleted executions are retained in the database for billing accuracy and excluded from all dashboard views.

## Environment Variables

Custom variables can be defined per-project in **Settings → Env Variables**:

- Encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM
- Injected directly into the test container at runtime
- Mark values as **Secret** to redact them from streamed logs

---

## AI Root-Cause Analysis

When a test fails:

1. Click the execution row to open the Investigation Hub.
2. Switch to the **AI Analysis** tab.
3. The two-step pipeline generates a diagnosis:
   - **Analyzer** — generates a structured root-cause and suggested fix
   - **Critic** — validates every claim against raw logs, eliminating hallucinations
4. The final output is clean, developer-facing Markdown.

**AI Model Artifact Persistence:** The specific `aiModel` used for the analysis is recorded as an immutable artifact alongside the execution, ensuring you always know which model generated the diagnosis, even if the organization's default model changes later.

AI analysis can be disabled per-organization in **Settings → Organization**.

---

## Auto-Quarantine & Quality Gate Bypass

Phase 5 introduces **Auto-Quarantine** to prevent flaky tests from blocking your CI/CD pipelines.

### How it Works
1. When a test fails **3 consecutive times**, Agnox automatically flags it as quarantined.
2. In the **Test Cases** table, these tests appear with a prominent **QUARANTINED** badge.
3. In the **Investigation Hub**, quarantined failures are dimmed and struck-through.

### Quality Gate Bypass
The Agnox CI/CD webhook (`POST /api/webhooks/ci/pr`) implements a smart quality gate:
- If an execution fails, but **all failed tests are currently quarantined**, the webhook will return a `PASSED` status to your CI provider (e.g., GitHub Actions).
- This ensures that known flaky tests do not halt your deployment pipeline while your team works on a fix.
- A test automatically "self-heals" and leaves quarantine as soon as it passes once.

> **Note:** Auto-Quarantine must be enabled in **Settings → Run Settings** for each project.

:::info Important: Consistent Group Names Required
The Auto-Quarantine mechanism relies on historical data to track consecutive failures. For the system to recognize that the *same* test is failing repeatedly across different runs, all those runs must be executed under the exact same **Execution Group** (`groupName`). 
If you trigger tests manually without a group name, or if your CI webhook generates dynamic/different group names per run, the quarantine logic will not trigger.
